## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.21+
- SQLite support (included via CGO)

### Running the Server
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:jhjaggars/package-tracking.git
cd package-tracking

# Run the server (creates database.db automatically)
go run cmd/server/main.go

# Server starts on http://localhost:8080
```

### Testing the API
```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:8080/api/health

# List carriers
curl http://localhost:8080/api/carriers

# Create a shipment (works immediately - no API keys required for USPS/UPS/FedEx!)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/shipments \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"tracking_number":"1Z999AA1234567890","carrier":"ups","description":"Test Package"}'

# Create a USPS shipment (also works without setup)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/shipments \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"tracking_number":"9400111899562347123456","carrier":"usps","description":"Priority Mail"}'

# Create a FedEx shipment (zero configuration required)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/shipments \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"tracking_number":"123456789012","carrier":"fedex","description":"FedEx Express"}''

# List shipments
curl http://localhost:8080/api/shipments
```

## 📊 Data Models

### Shipment
```go
type Shipment struct {
    ID               int        `json:"id"`
    TrackingNumber   string     `json:"tracking_number"`
    Carrier          string     `json:"carrier"`
    Description      string     `json:"description"`
    Status           string     `json:"status"`
    CreatedAt        time.Time  `json:"created_at"`
    UpdatedAt        time.Time  `json:"updated_at"`
    ExpectedDelivery *time.Time `json:"expected_delivery,omitempty"`
    IsDelivered      bool       `json:"is_delivered"`
}
```

### TrackingEvent
```go
type TrackingEvent struct {
    ID          int       `json:"id"`
    ShipmentID  int       `json:"shipment_id"`
    Timestamp   time.Time `json:"timestamp"`
    Location    string    `json:"location"`
    Status      string    `json:"status"`
    Description string    `json:"description"`
    CreatedAt   time.Time `json:"created_at"`
}
```

## 🌐 API Endpoints

### Shipments
- `GET /api/shipments` - List all shipments
- `POST /api/shipments` - Create new shipment
- `GET /api/shipments/{id}` - Get shipment by ID
- `PUT /api/shipments/{id}` - Update shipment
- `DELETE /api/shipments/{id}` - Delete shipment
- `GET /api/shipments/{id}/events` - Get tracking events for shipment

### System
- `GET /api/health` - Health check with database connectivity
- `GET /api/carriers` - List supported carriers
- `GET /api/carriers?active=true` - List only active carriers

## ⚙️ Configuration

Environment variables with sensible defaults:

```bash
# Server configuration
SERVER_HOST=localhost          # Server host
SERVER_PORT=8080              # Server port
DB_PATH=./database.db         # SQLite database path

# Feature configuration
UPDATE_INTERVAL=1h            # Background update interval
LOG_LEVEL=info               # Logging level (debug, info, warn, error)

# Carrier API keys (optional - system works without them!)
USPS_API_KEY=your_key          # Falls back to web scraping if not provided
UPS_API_KEY=your_key           # Falls back to web scraping if not provided  
FEDEX_API_KEY=your_key         # Falls back to web scraping if not provided
DHL_API_KEY=your_key           # Required for DHL tracking (web scraping not yet implemented)
```

**Note**: USPS, UPS, and FedEx tracking work immediately without any configuration! The system automatically falls back to web scraping when API keys are not configured. Only DHL currently requires API key configuration.

## 🧪 Testing

### Comprehensive Test Suite
```bash
# Run all tests
go test ./...

# Run tests with coverage
go test -cover ./...

# Run integration tests only
go test ./internal/server -run TestIntegration
```

### Test Coverage
- ✅ **Unit Tests**: All handlers, router, middleware, configuration
- ✅ **Integration Tests**: Full HTTP workflows with real server
- ✅ **Database Tests**: CRUD operations with in-memory SQLite
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Validation, edge cases, and failure scenarios

### Live Server Testing
```bash
# Test script with full API workflow
./test_server.sh

# Signal handling demonstration
./test_signal_comprehensive.sh
```

## 🔒 Security Features

- **Input Validation**: All required fields validated with proper error messages
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Prepared statements throughout
- **Security Headers**: XSS protection, frame options, content sniffing prevention
- **CORS Support**: Configurable cross-origin resource sharing
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Proper signal handling (SIGTERM, SIGINT)
- **Error Recovery**: Panic recovery middleware with safe error responses

## 🚦 Signal Handling

The server handles shutdown signals gracefully:

- **SIGTERM**: Graceful shutdown with 30-second timeout
- **SIGINT** (Ctrl+C): Graceful shutdown with cleanup
- **SIGKILL**: Immediate termination (uncatchable by design)

```bash
# Graceful shutdown
kill -TERM <pid>

# Force shutdown (not recommended)
kill -9 <pid>
```

## 🤝 Contributing

This project follows test-driven development (TDD) principles:

1. **Write tests first** for new functionality
2. **Implement** to make tests pass
3. **Refactor** while maintaining test coverage
4. **Document** changes in commit messages

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Run tests continuously during development
go test ./... -watch

# Check test coverage
go test -cover ./...

# Build and test the server
go build -o bin/server cmd/server/main.go
./bin/server
```

## 📝 Implementation Notes

### Design Principles
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Only SQLite driver beyond standard library
- **Test-Driven Development**: Comprehensive test suite written first
- **Clean Architecture**: Separate layers for database, handlers, and server logic
- **Production Ready**: Proper error handling, logging, and graceful shutdown
- **Extensible Design**: Easy to add new carriers, endpoints, and features
- **Resilient Tracking**: Multiple data sources (APIs + web scraping) for maximum reliability
- **Zero Configuration**: Works immediately for USPS/UPS/FedEx without any setup required
- **Automatic Fallback**: Seamless transition from API to web scraping when credentials unavailable
- **Respectful Automation**: Rate limiting and ethical web scraping practices

### Key Technical Decisions
- **SQLite over PostgreSQL**: Simpler deployment, sufficient for single-user system
- **Custom Router over Gorilla/Chi**: Educational value and zero dependencies
- **Standard Library HTTP**: Reliable, well-tested, and lightweight
- **In-Memory Testing**: Fast test execution without external dependencies
- **Unified Client Interface**: Consistent API across all carriers despite different authentication methods
- **Factory Pattern**: Automatic client selection based on available credentials and configuration
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: CarrierError type with retry and rate limit flags
- **Web Scraping Fallback**: Browser-like headers and respectful rate limiting for carrier websites
- **Test-Driven Development**: All carrier clients built with failing tests first
