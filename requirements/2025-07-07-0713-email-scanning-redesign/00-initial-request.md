# Initial Request

## User Request
completely change the implementation of email scanning to ignore searches and just ensure that the last 30 days (user configurable) of email is scanned for tracking information. Keep a copy of the email bodies so that the chain of relevant emails for a shipment can be review and re-summarized without requesting the mail from the mail server again.
