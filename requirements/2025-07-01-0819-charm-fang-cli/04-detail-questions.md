# Detail Questions - Charm Fang CLI Implementation

## Q6: Should we proceed with a phased approach by first enhancing the current urfave/cli implementation with Charm styling libraries (lipgloss, termenv) before considering a full migration to Cobra/Fang?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (reduces risk and provides immediate value while preserving stability)

**Context:** Since Fang requires a complete migration from urfave/cli to Cobra, a phased approach would allow us to add colors and styling immediately using lipgloss without breaking changes. This lets us deliver visual improvements quickly while planning a more comprehensive migration later.

## Q7: Should the CLI automatically detect when output is being piped or redirected and disable all styling to ensure clean text for scripts?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (standard practice for modern CLIs to ensure script compatibility)

**Context:** When users run commands like `package-tracker list | grep delivered`, the output should be plain text without ANSI escape codes. This is typically done by checking if stdout is a TTY (terminal) using isatty or similar detection.

## Q8: Do you want to add a new global flag like `--no-color` to explicitly disable styling even in interactive terminals?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (provides user control and follows CLI best practices)

**Context:** In addition to automatic detection, users should be able to force plain output with a flag. This is useful for users who prefer plain text or have accessibility needs. The flag would override any automatic detection.

## Q9: Should package status values (delivered, in-transit, pending, etc.) each have distinct color schemes in the enhanced table output?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (improves scanability and user experience)

**Context:** The current implementation shows status as plain text. With styling, we could use green for "delivered", yellow for "in-transit", blue for "pending", red for "failed", etc. This visual coding helps users quickly identify package states in long lists.

## Q10: Should we maintain the current 180-second timeout for refresh operations while adding visual progress indicators, or would you prefer to adjust timeouts?
**Default if unknown:** No (keep current timeout, just add visual feedback)

**Context:** The refresh command can take up to 3 minutes when using web scraping. Currently users see no feedback during this wait. Progress indicators would show the operation is still running, but the timeout duration itself has been tuned for reliability and shouldn't change.
