# Discovery Questions - Charm Fang CLI Styling

## Q1: Do you want to maintain the current table and JSON output formats while adding colors and better styling?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (preserves existing workflows while enhancing visual appeal)

**Context:** The current CLI supports both table and JSON formats. Adding Charm Fang could enhance the table format with colors, borders, and better alignment while keeping JSON output unchanged for programmatic use.

## Q2: Should the styled CLI work properly in environments without color support (CI/CD, older terminals)?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (maintains compatibility and professional appearance across all environments)

**Context:** Many deployment scripts and CI/CD pipelines capture CLI output. The enhanced styling should gracefully degrade or be disabled in non-interactive environments.

## Q3: Do you want to add interactive features like progress bars for refresh operations and server communication?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (modern CLIs provide feedback for long-running operations)

**Context:** The current CLI performs network operations (refresh, list, etc.) that can take time. Progress indicators would improve user experience during these operations.

## Q4: Should the enhanced CLI maintain backward compatibility with existing scripts and automation that parse the current output?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (prevents breaking existing integrations and user workflows)

**Context:** Users may have scripts that parse the current table or rely on specific output formats. Compatibility ensures smooth transition.

## Q5: Do you want to add new visual features like status icons, color-coded statuses, and improved error messages with suggestions?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (significantly improves user experience and makes the CLI more intuitive)

**Context:** Package tracking naturally has status information (delivered, in-transit, etc.) that would benefit from color coding and visual indicators. Error messages could also be enhanced with helpful suggestions.
