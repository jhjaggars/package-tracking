**Date:** 2025-07-01
**Answered by:** User

## Q6: Should we proceed with a phased approach by first enhancing the current urfave/cli implementation with Charm styling libraries (lipgloss, termenv) before considering a full migration to Cobra/Fang?
**Answer:** Yes

## Q7: Should the CLI automatically detect when output is being piped or redirected and disable all styling to ensure clean text for scripts?
**Answer:** Yes

## Q8: Do you want to add a new global flag like `--no-color` to explicitly disable styling even in interactive terminals?
**Answer:** Yes

## Q9: Should package status values (delivered, in-transit, pending, etc.) each have distinct color schemes in the enhanced table output?
**Answer:** Yes

## Q10: Should we maintain the current 180-second timeout for refresh operations while adding visual progress indicators, or would you prefer to adjust timeouts?
**Answer:** No (keep current timeout, just add visual feedback)

## Summary of Technical Decisions
- Phased approach confirmed - enhance current CLI first, migrate later
- Automatic TTY detection for script compatibility
- Explicit --no-color flag for user control
- Color-coded statuses for better UX
- Keep existing timeout values, focus on visual feedback
