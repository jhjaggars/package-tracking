## User Request
the cli should use bubbletea for the list.  Let's convert the static printed output to a persistent table that has control for selecting and operating on a record (like updating the description, refreshing, or even deleting)

## Context
User wants to enhance the CLI's list command by replacing the current static output with an interactive BubbleTea-powered table that allows users to:
- Select records from the table
- Perform operations on selected records:
  - Update description
  - Refresh tracking data
  - Delete records
- Maintain a persistent interactive interface rather than one-time output
