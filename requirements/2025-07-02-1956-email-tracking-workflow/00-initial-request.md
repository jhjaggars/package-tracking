# Initial Request

**Request:** Build an agentic workflow that reads email and looks for tracking numbers to add to the system. This should be a standalone process; not be included in the main server.

## Context
This request is for adding email processing capabilities to the existing package tracking system. The workflow should be autonomous and operate independently from the main server application.

## Key Requirements Identified
- Email reading capability
- Tracking number extraction/detection
- Integration with existing package tracking system
- Standalone process (separate from main server)
- Agentic/autonomous workflow
