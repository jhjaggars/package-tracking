# Initial Request

**Date:** 2025-01-04
**Request:** use https://github.com/spf13/viper to manage all configuration, ensure that the readme is up to date afterward

## Summary
Replace the current custom configuration management system with Viper, a popular Go configuration library that provides:
- Automatic environment variable binding
- Configuration file support (JSON, TOML, YAML, HCL, INI, and more)
- Live watching and re-reading of config files
- Setting defaults
- Reading from remote config systems
- Reading from command line flags
- Setting explicit values

This will standardize configuration management across all three applications (server, CLI, email-tracker) and provide additional features like hot-reloading and multiple format support.
