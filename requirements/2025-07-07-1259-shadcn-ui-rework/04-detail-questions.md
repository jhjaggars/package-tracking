# Expert Detail Questions

## Q1: Should we preserve the existing animated StatCard components with number animations in the Dashboard, or replace them with standard shadcn/ui Card components?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (the animated number counting and hover effects provide good UX and should be preserved in the new design)

## Q2: Should the mobile navigation be implemented using shadcn/ui Sheet component instead of the current custom mobile menu?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (shadcn/ui Sheet provides better accessibility and consistent mobile navigation patterns)

## Q3: Should we maintain the existing confetti celebration effect when packages are delivered, or remove it for a more professional look?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (the confetti effect adds delightful user experience and differentiates the app from generic tracking tools)

## Q4: Should the new design preserve the gradient backgrounds and glassmorphism effects in the Layout component?
**Default if unknown:** No (shadcn/ui follows more minimal design principles; plain backgrounds with proper shadows would be more consistent)

## Q5: Should we implement the new UI with shadcn/ui's built-in dark mode CSS variables, or keep the existing ThemeContext approach?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (shadcn/ui's CSS variable approach is more maintainable and provides better component theming integration)
