# Expert Requirements Questions

These detailed questions help clarify expected system behavior for the email-tracker Cobra conversion and .env support.

## Q6: Should we refactor the duplicate helper functions into internal/config/helpers.go to be shared between both config packages?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (follows DRY principle and reduces code duplication)

## Q7: Should email-tracker support a --config flag to specify an alternative .env file location for testing purposes?
**Default if unknown:** No (keeps it simple since users won't run multiple instances)

## Q8: Should the email-tracker CLI have subcommands (like 'run', 'validate', 'version') or just run directly when executed?
**Default if unknown:** No (daemon applications typically run directly without subcommands)

## Q9: Should we preserve the existing printUsage() function content as Cobra's Long description for the root command?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (maintains existing documentation and user expectations)

## Q10: Should email-tracker support a --dry-run flag at the CLI level that overrides the EMAIL_DRY_RUN environment variable?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (CLI flags should take precedence over environment variables for testing)
