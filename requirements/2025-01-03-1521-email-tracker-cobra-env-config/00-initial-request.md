# Initial Request

**Date:** 2025-01-03 15:21
**Request:** email-tracker should read configuration from the .env file. If it is not a cobra application it should be ported to be a cobra application.

## Summary
The user wants to ensure that the email-tracker application:
1. Reads its configuration from the .env file
2. Is implemented as a Cobra CLI application (converted if necessary)

This involves analyzing the current implementation and potentially refactoring it to use the Cobra framework for better CLI structure and consistency with other applications in the codebase.
